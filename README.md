This is my personal project that I started in June 2017. My goal is to design a web app that allows veterinarians and nurses a tool to share cases and professional advices. Coming from a veterinary background, this would help in so many ways and help the community.  


Steps:
------
1. Download/Clone this project 
2. Install Node from nodejs.org (if you do not have Node installed).
3. Install dependencies by running npm install. May see warnings, but it will be fine as long as no errors. A node_modules folder is created.
4. Run npm run build - to run one of the scripts I wrote in the seed project. It runs a build process which takes all the Angular code, converts them from TypeScript to JavaScript and bundles them together. Keep this command running to watch for changes in your TypeScript code so you don't have to re-run this command. Npm run build runs Angular code for the front-end.
5. Open up a new Terminal window. Run npm start to run our NodeJS server which runs our server-side code.  Keep this command running.
6. Open localhost/3000 in your browser, you should see Hello World! displayed on the web page.
